			<p id="words">I come from two hardworking portuguese-immigrant parents. Both settled here in New Jersey, my father was running his own restaurant when he met my mother, the owner of a beauty-salon. They would end up tying the knot, on April 6th, 1991. Months later, your’s truly was brought into the world on September 4th, 1992, marking it the greatest global holiday. 
			I was raised in your typical portuguese household, to becoming enemies with the mighty wooden-spoon, to having big Sunday lunches, to knowing meals aren't complete until rice, potatoes, or even both are on your plate. My parents started me off playing soccer at the age of 4, for the local portuguese social club. I played competitively until the I turned 18,during those years I can say I’ve met guys that I can consider to be my brothers. Our team disbanded, because we all went to different colleges. I attended Kean University for a year, and  after did a semester at Union County College, until I realised that college wasn’t for me, so i thought. 
			While at Kean, and Union County College, i was working full time at night, for  the City of Elizabeth Municipal Court. No other job was as entertaining, as traffic court night hours. I would come across all types of human beings, good and bad, crazy and sane. After working about 3 years there, i was given another position working during the day at city hall, as a clerk for the administration department. The gigs not to bad, but working here made me realise that college wasn't for me, it was that I was to immature for it. This is probably my motivation to where i am at now, which is taking this web development course, to create so different paths in my life.</p>
